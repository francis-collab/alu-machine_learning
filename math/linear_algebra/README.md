# Linear Algebra in Python

This project contains Python scripts and functions for basic linear algebra operations, including matrix slicing, transposition, addition, concatenation, and multiplication. Tasks are implemented both with pure Python and NumPy for educational purposes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.5
- NumPy 1.15 (for tasks 9-14)
- Follows pycodestyle 2.5

## Tasks
- 0: Slicing lists
- 1: Extracting columns
- 2: Matrix shape
- 3: Matrix transpose
- 4: Array addition
- 5: 2D matrix addition
- 6: Array concatenation
- 7: 2D matrix concatenation
- 8: Matrix multiplication (pure Python)
- 9: NumPy slicing
- 10: NumPy shape
- 11: NumPy transpose
- 12: NumPy element-wise operations
- 13: NumPy concatenation
- 14: NumPy matrix multiplication

Each file is executable and includes documentation.

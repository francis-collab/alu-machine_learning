# Plotting with Matplotlib

This project demonstrates fundamental data visualization techniques using **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** (version 3.0) as part of the ALU Machine Learning curriculum.

## Project Overview

The following tasks explore different types of plots commonly used in data analysis:

- Line plots (including cubic functions)
- Scatter plots
- Exponential decay curves with logarithmic scaling
- Multiple overlaid line plots with legends
- Histograms (frequency distribution)
- Multi-plot figure layout
- Stacked bar charts
